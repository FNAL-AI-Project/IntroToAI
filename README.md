## Useful Resources for Starting in Machine Learning
Last Updated by Gabriel Perdue on 2019/December/20

## General purpose

* The Google Machine Learning Crash Course:
  * https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/
* Deep Learning (book) - probably the best overall textbook in the field for a general practitioner:
  * Textbook by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville
  * http://www.deeplearningbook.org/
  * For a complete PDF, visit: https://github.com/janishar/mit-deep-learning-book-pdf.git
* Practical Deep Learning for Coders:
  * 7x 2-hour videos
  * Theory is de-emphasized in exchange for a focus on power-use of the PyTorch and Fastai library
  * https://course.fast.ai/
* Deep Learning from the Foundations:
  * 7x 2-hour videos
  * Recovers some of the theory skipped in “Practical Deep Learning for Coders”
  * https://course.fast.ai/part2
* Other Fastai video courses, links, etc.
  * https://www.fast.ai/
* https://distill.pub
  * Distill collects essays on the underlying mechanics and math and pairs them with very nice visualizations of key concepts.
* Dive Into Deep Learning:
  * http://d2l.ai/
  * Interactive deep learning notebooks from a fundamental level based on NumPy.

## Convolutional Neural Nets

* Stanford CS 231n
  * http://cs231n.github.io
  * This is a sophisticated course focusing specifically on Convolutional NNs - the software is out of date but the lecture material remains excellent.

## TensorFlow

* The TensorFlow web page is an excellent resource - most of their tutorial modules come with links to an executable Google Colab notebook, so they are easy to play with (with a GPU) on the web for free.
  * https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/
* Stanford CS 20
  * https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/syllabus.html
  * This is a fairly compact course on how to use TensorFlow 1.X (code is not current with TF 2.X, so be careful of that) with a good GitHub repo of example code backing up the lecture slides.

## PyTorch

* The PyTorch web page is also an excellent resource with tutorial notebooks executable in a Google Colab notebook for free
  * https://pytorch.org/tutorials/
